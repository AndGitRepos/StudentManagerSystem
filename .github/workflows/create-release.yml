            ## Quick Start
            1. Download the appropriate JAR for your platform and the run scripts
            2. Make sure Java 21 is installed
            3. Run using one of these methods:
               - Windows: Double-click `run.bat`
               - Mac/Linux: Run `./run.sh`
               - Any platform: `java -jar StudentManagementSystem-[platform].jar`
            
            ## Requirements
            - Java 21 or later
            
            ## Files Included
            - StudentManagementSystem-windows.jar (Windows build)
            - StudentManagementSystem-mac.jar (macOS build)
            - StudentManagementSystem-linux.jar (Linux build)
            - run.sh (Unix/Mac launcher)
            - run.bat (Windows launcher)
            - README.md (Instructions)

            ## Platform-Specific Builds
            Each JAR was built on its native platform for maximum compatibility.
            Choose the appropriate JAR for your operating system.
